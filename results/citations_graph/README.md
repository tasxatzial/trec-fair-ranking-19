# Graph analysis

Analysis of the pagerank graph structure of the citations. Nodes, citations and edges are used interchangeably. IN/OUT edges refer to incoming/outgoing edges. A loop edge is a citation that points to itself.

* **[citations_graph_stats](citations_graph_stats)**:
  * `Documents`: Total number of nodes.
  * `Sinks`: Number of nodes that do not have any OUT edges.
  * `Sinks + (self references)`: Number of nodes that do not have any OUT edges. Includes nodes that have loop OUT edges.
  * `In edges - (self references + multiple references)`: Number of IN edges. Does not include loop IN edges. Multiple same IN edges are counted 1 time.
  * `In edges`: Number of IN edges.
  * `Out edges - (self references + multiple references)`: Number of OUT edges. Does not include loop OUT edges. Multiple same OUT edges are counted 1 time.
  * `Out edges`: Number of OUT edges.
  * `Duplicate In edges - (self references)`: Number of unnessecary IN edges. Does not include loop IN edges.
  * `Documents with duplicate In edges - (self references)`: Number of nodes that have unnessecary IN edges. Does not include nodes that do not have unnessecary IN edges but have loop IN edges.
  * `Duplicate Out edges - (self references)`: Number of unnessecary OUT edges. Does not include loop OUT edges.
  * `Documents with duplicate Out edges - (self references)`: Number of nodes that have unnessecary OUT edges. Does not include nodes that do not have unnessecary OUT edges but have loop OUT edges.
  * `Self referencing documents via In edges`: Number of nodes that have loop IN edges.
  * `Self referencing In edges`: Number of loop IN edges.
  * `Self referencing documents via Out edges`: Number of nodes that have loop OUT edges.
  * `Self referencing Out edges`: Number of loop OUT edges.
  * `In edges which are not listed in the Out edges of the source node`.
  * `Out edges which are not listed in the In edges of the source node`.
* **[citations_not_found_graph_stats](citations_not_found_graph_stats)**:
  * `Documents`: Total number of nodes.
  * `Total not found In edges - (multiple references)`: IN citations that are not included in the collection. Multiple references of the same IN citation in an article are counted 1 time. Multiple references of the same IN citation across different articles are counted separately.
  * `Unique not found In edges - (multiple references)`: IN citations that are not included in the collection. Multiple references of the same IN citation in the collection are counted 1 time.
  * `Total not found Out edges - (multiple references)`: OUT citations that are not included in the collection. Multiple references of the same OUT citation in an article are counted 1 time. Multiple references of the same OUT citation across different articles are counted separately.
  * `Unique not found Out edges - (multiple references)`: OUT citations that are not included in the collection. Multiple references of the same OUT citation in the collection are counted 1 time.
* **[in_edges](in_edges)**: Histogram of the number of IN citations.
* **[in_edges_not_found](in_edges_not_found)**: Histogram of the number of IN citations that are not found in the collection. Multiple same IN citations in an article are counted 1 time.
* **[in_edges_true](in_edges_true)**: Histogram of the number of IN citations. Multiple references of the same IN citation in an article are counted 1 time. Loop IN citations are not counted.
* **[out_edges](out_edges)**: Histogram of the number of OUT citations.
* **[out_edges_not_found](out_edges_not_found)**: Histogram of the number of OUT citations that are not found in the collection. Multiple same OUT citations in an article are counted 1 time.
* **[out_edges_true](out_edges_true)**: Histogram of the number of OUT citations. Multiple references of the same OUT citation in an article are counted 1 time. Loop OUT citations are not counted.
